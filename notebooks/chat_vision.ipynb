      "There are limited options for vegans on this menu, as many dishes include animal-based ingredients like cheese, cream, meat, and seafood. However, a few dishes could potentially be adapted to suit a vegan diet. Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Possible Vegan/Adaptable Options:\n",
      "1. **Spinaci Soffritti** (Antipasti) - Fresh spinach sautéed with lemon and garlic. This dish appears to be naturally vegan.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Insalata Di Maria** (Zuppe & Insalate) - Seasonal greens, farro salad, cherry tomatoes, and avocado, tossed with Carmine’s House Vinaigrette. Double-check the vinaigrette to ensure it doesn't contain honey or other non-vegan ingredients.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Panzenella con Fagioli** (Zuppe & Insalate) - Vine tomatoes, bread salad, onions, cannellini beans, cucumbers, and avocado, tossed with Carmine’s House Vinaigrette. Check whether the bread is made without dairy or eggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Spaghetti Ortolano** (Pasta & Risotto) - Arugula, tomatoes, pine nuts, and extra virgin olive oil. Omit the goat cheese to make it vegan.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions:\n",
      "- Ask the staff if substitutions or customizations are possible, such as removing cheese or using vegan dressings/sauces.\n",
      "- Confirm any hidden animal-based additions in dishes like vinaigrettes, breads, or roasted vegetables.\n",
