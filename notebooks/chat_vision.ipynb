      "- **Spinaci Soffritti (8)**: Fresh spinach sautéed with lemon and garlic. Ensure no butter or animal-based oils are used for preparation.\n",
      "- **Bruschetta Trio (18)**: The avocado, smoked salmon, and crème fraiche bruschetta sounds flexible. Ask if it can be served without the salmon and crème fraiche, and confirm the base bread is vegan.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Zuppe & Insalate:\n",
      "- **Panzanella con Fagioli (18)**: A vine tomato and bread salad mixed with onions, beans, cucumbers, and avocado. Ask the kitchen to confirm that Carmine's House Vinaigrette is vegan.\n",
      "- **Insalata Di Mista (13)**: Seasonal greens tossed in the house vinaigrette. Double-check if the dressing is vegan and skip the option of adding chicken or steak.  \n",
      "- **Zuppa Di Fagioli (11)**: Tuscan beans and pasta soup. Ensure it is made with vegetable stock (not meat-based).  \n",
      "- **Portofino Salad (18)**: Tomatoes, nicoise olives, and vegetables. You’ll need to request no egg, anchovies, or tuna.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pasta:\n",
      "While none of the listed pasta dishes are vegan, you could inquire with the chef if there is a plain pasta primavera or vegetable pasta option available, made with olive oil and without cheese, cream, or other animal ingredients.\n",
      "\n",
